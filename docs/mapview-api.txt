# MapView API - Provides a Map Interface

The [MapView Class API](http://docs.rhomobile.com/rhodes/device-caps#mapview) provides an embeddable map interface with the create method and various settings and annotations depending on the map provider (such as Google).

ZZZZZZZ Hmmph, really, is this accurate below?!?!?!

## MapView.create map_params - Create a map on your device.

map_params - A hash (ZZZZZZZZ yes? this is a hash?) consisting of:

provider - The provider. 'Google' supported on iPhone, Android and Blackberry. 'ESRI' supported on iPhone, Android, Blackberry, and Windows Mobile.
settings - Map settings.
annotations - array of map annotation objects (list of pins on the map).

### settings

map_type - display "standard", "satellite", or "hybrid" map.

region - two types allowed:

* [latitude,longitude,latitudeDelta,longitudeDelta]. The area displayed by the map view.  
latitude,longitude - the map coordinate of the region center.  
latitudeDelta – Degrees of north-to-south distance. One degree of latitude is approximately 111 kilometers (69 miles).
longitudeDelta – Degrees of east-to-west distance. One degree of longitude is approximately 111 kilometers (69 milies) at the equator, and 0 kilometers at the poles.

* {:center => center, :radius => radius}. The area displayed by the map view.
center – string describing center of area that is allowed by google geocoding service. Examples: “1 infinite loop, cupertino, ca 95014”, “California, USA”, “37.365519,-121.982918”

ZZZZZ add urls for here
