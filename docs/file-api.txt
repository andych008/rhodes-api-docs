## File API - Access the Rhodes File Structure

The [File Class API](http://docs.rhomobile.com/rhodes/device-caps#file-system-access) allows access to the Rhodes file structure.

ZZZZZZ Is this the general Ruby File API? Why binread? I guessed it is for media.

`join(string, string)` - Joins two strings.  
`open(fileName)` - Open a file.  
`write(content)` - Write to a file.  
`close` - Close a file.  
`binread(fileName)` - Read a file (binread for images and other media).
